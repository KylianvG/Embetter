    "Ensuring fairness in algorithmically-driven decision-making is important to avoid inadvertent cases of bias and perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. However, modern natural language processing techniques, which learn model parameters based on data, might rely on implicit biases presented in the data to make undesirable stereotypical associations. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. Recent results ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07187)) show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because of their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. \n",
