    "$\\textbf{Abstract:}$ This report attempts to reproduce the word embedding debiasing algorithm and replicate experiments from Bolukbasi, Chang, Zou, Saligrama, and Kalai (2016). We adapt the publicly available implementation (https://github.com/tolga-b/debiaswe) and extend it with the soft debiasing method described in their paper. Several popular benchmarks are integrated in order to evaluate the word embeddings before and after debiasing. Besides replicating results on Word2vec, the effectiveness of the debiasing algorithms is investigated on GloVe and fastText embeddings. We show that the removal of direct bias for all the embeddings barely affects their expressiveness through a comparison of benchmark scores. However, we fail to reproduce large scale soft debiasing results as the method described by the authors is not realistically applicable."

    "In hard debiasing, the gender neutral words are shifted to zero in the gender subspace (i.e. neutralized) by subtracting the projection of the neutral word embedding vector onto the gender subspace and renormalizing the resulting embedding to unit length. \n",

    "Soft debiasing is done by solving the following optimization problem as mentioned in their paper:\n",

    "where W is the matrix of all embedding vectors, N is the matrix of the embedding vectors of the gender neutral words, B is the gender subspace, and T is the debiasing transformation that minimizes the projection of the neutral words onto the gender subspace but tries to maintain the pairwise inner products between the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the optimization, we adapted specifics from Manzini, Chong, Black, and Tsvetkov (2019), where our code is based on the code they provide (https://github.com/TManzini/DebiasMulticlassWordEmbedding)."
