    "$\\textbf{Abstract:}$ In this paper we reproduce the word embedding debiasing algorithm from Bolukbasi et al. [2]. We adapt the available implementation and extend it with their soft debiasing method. We integrate several popular benchmarks and investigate the effectiveness of the algorithm on GloVe and fastText embeddings besides the Word2vec embeddings used by Bolukbasi et al. [2]. We show that the removal of direct bias from all the different embeddings barely affects their effectiveness through a comparison of benchmark scores. However, we fail to reproduce the large scale soft debiasing results due to a lack of detail on the original implementation."
